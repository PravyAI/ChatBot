# ChatBot
Universal Chat Bot

# Introduction
My goal was to create a chatbot that could talk to people in real-time. In order to create a chatbot, or really do any machine learning task, of course, the first job you have is to acquire training data, then you need to structure and prepare it to be formatted in a "input" and "output" manner that a machine learning algorithm can digest.So i have used reddit 1 month data to trained the model ( approx 50 million dataset).

I have used NMT - Neural Machine Translation (seq2seq) to build the bot.

# Setup
Steps to setup project for your needs: It is highly recommended that you use Python 3.6+. Python 3.4 and 3.5 is likely to work in Linux, but you will eventually hit encoding errors with 3.5 or lower in a Windows environment.

Step to run the bot

Open Shell and Go to bot directory and run the following command:

``` shell
python inference.py
```
